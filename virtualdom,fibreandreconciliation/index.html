create Root method makes dom like structure , behind the scene  main dom and your dom compare and 
update those things which is actually updated in ui/ux  in virtual dom 
browser will update all the things as it reloads the page ,but virtual dom will only update the things which are 
actually changed in ui/ux

react fiber behind the scene used react fiber for the virtual dom implementation 
reconciliation - reconsider which to update , 

traditional applications used to talk directly with the server but the react app communicates with the api for data request 
and data updates specifices porportion without happening to rendering whole pages 
client  side rendering - react js
SERVER SIDE rendering -  traditional website 
react cant alone done the website only deals with the front end 
allows us to create large web applucations that changes data without reloading the webpage 

react was developed by facebook
react is simple and uses syntax like jsx
in demand skill
mobile application development with react native
can  be used with anything django, express js , firebase etc
React is component based smallest building block of react application
components are reusable
control+c for to stop server 

react is single page application only one index.html so it is called single page application

Component is always capital letter ,  <Component />
return jsx 

Components can be written like this too
  <Hello></Hello>
  javascript extension javascript plus html jsx (JSX)
  html file doesnt allow us to use javascript directly but here in jsx we can use javascript directly in jsx javascript code is written in {}
  components helps to hide complexity and reuse code

   {/* here passing string to the props but can pass array too */}
    <Hello name="Mike" />
const seatNumbers=[1,4,7];
     <Hello name="Rob"  message="hI there" seatNumbers={seatNumbers}/>


     
const person={name:"Rob",message:"hI there",seatNumbers:seatNumbers};
  <Hello person={person} />
  for objects we can pass the entire object as a prop 
  props.person.name like this to access the object properties in the component file

     <ul> {fruits.map(fruit=><li key={fruit}>{fruit}</li>)}</ul>




      <li key={fruit.name}>
                    {fruit.emoji} {fruit.name} - ${fruit.price}
                </li>
            ))}
